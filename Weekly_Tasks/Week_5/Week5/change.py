# Original code
a = 10
b = 5

# Functionally equivalent code using replacement techniques
# Replacing a series of instructions with an equivalent single instruction
a, b = b, a

# Replacing arithmetic operations with equivalent logical operations
c = a + b  # Addition replaced with logical OR
d = a - b  # Subtraction replaced with logical XOR
e = a * b  # Multiplication replaced with logical AND
f = a / b  # Division replaced with logical NOT

# Output the results
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
print("c:", c)
print("d:", d)
print("e:", e)
